<h2>About Me</h2>  
<p align="left">My name is Timotheus Keanu. Currently, I am a PhD student in mathematics at Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington (New Zealand). My research is in algebraic number theory, 
  particularly the arithmetic of elliptic curves. I previously studied for my Masters at the University of Nottingham (UK) and for my bachelor at Institut Teknologi Bandung (Indonesia). 
  
  My research project, under the supervision of B.D. Kim, focus on developing tools to  further formulate Iwasawa theory for supersingular elliptic curves. My main approach is by using Fontaine's theory of 
  p-divisible groups and deformation theory. I am the organiser for VUW's mathematics postgrad seminar for 2024-2025.

<h2>Research Interest</h2> 
  <p align="left">My main interest is in Iwasawa theory for elliptic curves, emphasis on curves with good supersingular reductions. The supersingular curves are notably more commplex than the ordinary case,
  but in recent decades there have been a good progress in this direction. My current project to develop Iwasawa theory is mainly influenced by the works of Kobayashi and Perrin-Riou.</p>
